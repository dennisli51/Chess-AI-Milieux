# Chess-AI-Milieux

Chess AI Milieux will be a chess environment with 3 interactive experiences. One is a standard player versus player chess game. The second mode will be a player vs AI mode where the user can select the difficulty parameters of the AI opponent and play against it. The third mode will be an AI exhibition mode where the player can choose the depth of both AIâ€™s and press a button to make each side move so that they can play against each other. 

Run the File titled "TermProject.py" to run the project. 

At the title screen, press 1, 2, 3 to choose between the modes Player v Player, Player v AI, AI v AI Exhibition. 

At each of the 3 modes, Pressing "R" will reset the game and any parameters. Pressing "B" will return to the opening screen (game progression is still saved).

For the AI vs AI and AI vs Player, first you will have to press a digit between 0-3 to assign a depth to the Black AI. For the AI Exhibition Battle, you will have to press a digit a second time to assign a value to White's AI.
